# 💖 Be My Valentine? 
This is a cute and interactive Valentine's Day proposal website that makes saying "No" a fun challenge! 🥰

## ✨ Features
- 🐻 Adorable GIFs that change with every "No" click.
- 🎨 Interactive Buttons:
- Clicking No makes the Yes button grow bigger!
- After 10 "No" clicks, the Yes button gradually fills the screen.
- 💬 Custom Messages appear with each "No" click to convince your special someone.
- 💕 Heart Animation fills the screen when "Yes" is clicked.
- 🎉 Happy Pikachu GIF appears when "Yes" is chosen!

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The user sees a cute "Will you be my Valentine?" message with a bear GIF.
2. Clicking "No":
    - The Yes button gets bigger.
    - The bear GIF changes to a sadder version.
    - A new message appears, urging them to reconsider.
3. After 10 "No" clicks, the Yes button expands smoothly to fit the entire screen.
4. Clicking "Yes" removes the "No" button and triggers floating hearts and a happy Pikachu GIF!
